# Bidirectional 3-Hop Traversal in Neo4j

*Created on 2025-05-12T13:57:11+00:00*

## Overview

Bidirectional 3-Hop Traversal is an advanced technique for traversing knowledge graphs in both directions with up to 3 hops. This technique enables more efficient path finding by simultaneously traversing from both source and target nodes, significantly improving performance for complex path queries compared to unidirectional traversal.

## Key Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: Significantly reduces search space compared to unidirectional traversal
- **Efficient Path Finding**: Finds connections between distantly related entities more efficiently
- **Optimized Query Execution**: Limits traversal depth to maintain performance while discovering meaningful connections
- **Balanced Exploration**: Explores the graph from both ends, focusing on the most promising paths

## Implementation Example

```cypher
// Bidirectional 3-hop traversal between two entities
MATCH path = (source:Entity {name: $sourceEntity}), (target:Entity {name: $targetEntity})
CALL {
  // Forward traversal from source (max 3 hops)
  WITH source
  MATCH (source)-[r1:RELATES_TO*1..3]->(mid)
  RETURN mid as forwardNode, length(r1) as forwardSteps
  
  UNION
  
  // Backward traversal from target (max 3 hops)
  WITH target
  MATCH (target)<-[r2:RELATES_TO*1..3]-(mid)
  RETURN mid as backwardNode, length(r2) as backwardSteps
}

// Find collision points (where forward and backward traversals meet)
WITH source, target, forwardNode, forwardSteps, backwardNode, backwardSteps
WHERE forwardNode = backwardNode
AND forwardSteps + backwardSteps <= 3  // Ensure total path length â‰¤ 3

// Reconstruct the full path
MATCH p1 = (source)-[r1:RELATES_TO*1..3]->(forwardNode)
MATCH p2 = (forwardNode)<-[r2:RELATES_TO*1..3]-(target)
WHERE length(r1) = forwardSteps AND length(r2) = backwardSteps

// Return the complete path with relationship details
RETURN p1, p2, forwardNode as collisionPoint
ORDER BY forwardSteps + backwardSteps ASC
LIMIT 5
```

## Implementation Details

This implementation demonstrates how to:

1. Perform forward traversal from the source node (up to 3 hops)
2. Perform backward traversal from the target node (up to 3 hops)
3. Identify collision points where both traversals meet
4. Ensure the total path length doesn't exceed the specified limit
5. Reconstruct and return the complete path with details

The bidirectional approach is significantly more efficient than unidirectional traversal for finding paths between distant nodes, as it reduces the search space exponentially.

## Usage Guidelines

When implementing bidirectional traversal in your knowledge graph:

1. **Limit Hop Count**: Keep the maximum hop count reasonable (3-4 hops) to maintain performance
2. **Use Selective Relationships**: Consider filtering by relationship types to focus the traversal
3. **Add Collision Detection**: Implement efficient collision detection to identify where traversals meet
4. **Consider Path Reconstruction**: Plan how to reconstruct the full path from partial paths
5. **Add Ordering**: Order results by total path length to prioritize shorter connections
