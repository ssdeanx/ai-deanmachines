 * This file can be used to define common types, interfaces, or Zod schemas
 * that are shared across multiple tools within this directory.
 *
 * For example:
 * import { z } from 'zod';
 *
 * export const CommonIdSchema = z.string().uuid().describe("A common unique identifier");
 *
 * export interface SharedToolConfig {
 *   timeoutMs?: number;
 *   retryAttempts?: number;
 * }

// Currently, no shared types are defined. Add them here as needed.
// You can also export complex Zod schemas from here to keep tool files cleaner.

export {}; // Add this to ensure it's a module
