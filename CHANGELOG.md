  - Added proper documentation for exported types and classes
  - Structured exports to support tree-shaking and module optimization

### Fixed

- Resolved circular dependency issues in agent implementations:
  - Moved type definitions to separate files
  - Used proper import/export patterns to avoid circular references
  - Ensured consistent type usage across all agent implementations

- Refactored `llmMetrics` in `src/mastra/observability/telemetry.ts` to `getLlmMetrics()`, a lazily initialized function, to prevent premature calls to OpenTelemetry's `getMeter()` before the SDK is fully initialized by Mastra core.

### Problems Encountered

- Memory integration challenges:
  - Complex Memory.addMessage method requiring 7 parameters (threadId, content, role, type, metadata, originalRole, originalType)
  - Inconsistent parameter ordering between different memory implementations
  - Type safety issues with message role and type validation
  - Challenges with proper error handling for memory operations
  - Difficulties with thread management and message retrieval

  **Resolution**: Created a MessageSchema using Zod to validate message objects before passing to memory. Implemented wrapper functions to handle the complex parameter ordering and ensure consistent usage across the codebase. Added comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks around all memory operations.

- Async iterator implementation for streaming:
  - Challenges implementing proper Symbol.asyncIterator for stream responses
  - Issues with TypeScript typing for async iterables
  - Difficulties ensuring compatibility with different consumer patterns
  - Problems with error propagation through async iterators
  - Challenges with proper resource cleanup after streaming

  **Resolution**: Implemented a simplified async iterator that returns the complete text in a single iteration, making it compatible with for-await loops while avoiding complex streaming logic. Added proper TypeScript types for async iterables and ensured error propagation through the promise chain.

- Tool execution complexities:
  - Difficulties with proper typing for tool arguments and results
  - Challenges with runtime context passing to tools
  - Issues with error handling during tool execution
  - Problems with storing tool execution results in memory
  - Complexities with tool registration and management

  **Resolution**: Created a ToolCallPayload interface to standardize tool call structure. Implemented a RuntimeContext interface to pass context to tools in a type-safe manner. Added comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks and proper error logging. Stored tool execution results in memory with proper validation.

- Middleware pattern implementation:
  - Challenges with proper typing for middleware functions
  - Issues with sequential middleware application
  - Difficulties with middleware cancellation handling
  - Problems with passing context through middleware chain
  - Complexities with error handling in middleware

  **Resolution**: Defined a clear AgentMiddleware type with proper TypeScript typing. Implemented sequential middleware application with a for-loop to ensure proper order. Added support for middleware cancellation by returning null. Passed agent instance, options, and messages to middleware for context. Added try/catch blocks for each middleware to prevent chain failures.

- Telemetry integration issues:
  - Challenges with proper span creation and attribute tagging
  - Issues with metric recording for LLM operations
  - Difficulties with error tracking in telemetry
  - Problems with proper span ending in error cases
  - Complexities with nested span creation and management

  **Resolution**: Used OpenTelemetry's getTracer function to create properly named tracers. Added span attributes for input length and options. Ensured spans are ended in finally blocks to prevent leaks. Implemented recordLLMMetrics function for consistent metric recording. Added proper error attributes to spans when exceptions occur.
